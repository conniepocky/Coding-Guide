 Hi Mummy!

 I made this tutorial for you so you can follow along and learn to code :)

 OKay so first open Atom (or Vim) and type print("hi") then save the file as first.py 
 to run your .py file type in your terminal
 python first.py
 That should run hi in the terminal!!!! If your code doesn't work try checking mine :)
